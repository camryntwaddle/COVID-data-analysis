# COVID Data Analysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to my honors assignment on COVID data analysis. This repo aims to show my experience with R, data cleaning and analysis, and data visualisation. This assignment involved using COVID-19 data from South Africa and around the world to extract meaningful information and present it in a clear, intuitive format. This was achieved through various analytical techniques. This assignment was initially completed in RStudio using a Quarto notebook.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following important files and folders:

-   **23560444_Assignment1_files/:** Directory containing supporting files for the analysis.
-   **data/:** Directory containing raw data files used in the analysis.
-   **23560444_Assignment1.html:** HTML output of the final report.
-   **23560444_Assignment1.pdf:** PDF version of the final report.
-   **23560444_Assignment1.qmd:** Quarto markdown file containing the code and documentation.
-   **Assignment1.Rproj:** RStudio project file for the assignment.
-   **hons_da_assignment_1_brief.pdf:** Project brief outlining the assignment requirements.

## Project Description

This project involves several key steps:

-   **Data Sourcing:** Finding useful data that could be used for meaningful analysis.
-   **Data Handling:** Reading and exploring the data. Cleaning through handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
-   **Data Analysis:** Performing exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the COVID-19 data.
-   **Data Visualisation:** Recreating existing graphs to visualize the impact of COVID-19 in South Africa. Creating new graphs on different data to explore different countries, trends and creative visualisation techniques.

## Usage

This repository is for viewing purposes only. If you are interested in the details of the analysis or the visualizations created, please explore the following files:

-   **hons_da_assignment_1_brief.pdf:** View the brief pdf for a detailed understanding of what the project entailed and the expected outputs.
-   **23560444_Assignment1.pdf:** View the PDF report to see the graphs created through the analysis.
-   **23560444_Assignment1.qmd:** Review the Quarto markdown file for the code and documentation.

As mentioned, this assignment was completed using RStudio and the qmd notebook is best viewed through such a program. Some graphs lose their interactivity in the PDF report, but these interactive graphs are pointed out in the documentation and the interactive code is still included in the notebook.

### Notes on this repo

This assignment was uploaded as a representation of my data analysis skills in R at the time. All data sources used are publicly available and cited within the notebook and the pdf report.

This assignment was completed on 3 May 2024 as part of the Stellenbosch University Bachelor of Informatics Honours program.
